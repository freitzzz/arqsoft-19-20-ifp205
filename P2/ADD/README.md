## ARQSOFT 2019 / 2020 (Part 2)

### Roadmap

The software being developed is a brownfield system, so it is proposed the following roadmap for each ADD iteration

**Iteration 1**

- Goal: Refine software architecture

- Description: In this iteration it is intended that the design of the previously developed software architecture is refined to include new architectural drivers

- Design Concepts:
  - Choose Deployment Patterns
  - Choose Externally Developed Components (e.g. Frameworks)

**Iteration 2**

- Goal: Support primary functionality (fine-grain architectural view)

- Description: In this iteration it is intended that the design of the functional requirements and restrictions is settled in a fine-grain architectural view 

- Design Concepts:
  - Choose Architectural Patterns
  - Relate Externaly Developed Components with chosen Architectural Patterns

**Iteration 3**

- Goal: Support quality attribute scenarios and concerns

- Description: In this iteration it is intended that the design of the quality attribute scenarios and concerns is settled

- Design Concepts:
  - Analyze, and choose Tactics
  - Relate Architectural and Deployment Patterns with choosen Tactics
  - Relate Externally Developed Components with choosen Tactics

| UC13 | Add Ingredients | The kitchen workers can insert ingredients | Medium | High |Stakeholder Feedback (Pre-iteration 1)|Iteration 3|
| UC14 | Consult meal allergens | It is necessary to provide a mechanism that allows the retrieval of the allergens of a specific meal. This use of this mechanism should be available to everyone without the need of authentication | High |Low| Pre-iteration 4 | -- |
| UC15 | Consult meal ingredients | It is necessary to provide a mechanism that allows the retrieval of the ingredients of a specific meal. This use of this mechanism should be available to everyone without the need of authentication | High |Low| Pre-iteration 4 | -- |
| UC16 | Consult meal nutritional data | It is necessary to provide a mechanism that allows the retrieval of the nutritional data of a specific meal. This use of this mechanism should be available to everyone without the need of authentication | High |Low| Pre-iteration 4 | -- |
| UC17 | Specify new PoS (Point of Sell) | It is necessary to specify the existing PoS as items are only available in each PoS | High | Medium | Pre-iteration 4 | -- |
| UC18 | Transfer item between PoS | It is possible that an item is transfered from one point of sell to other point of sell | Medium | High | Pre-iteration 4 | -- |
| UC19 | Query item quantity availability | It is necessary to provide a mechanism that allows the retrieval of the available items for a specific meal | High | Medium | Pre-iteration 4 | -- |


**Constraints**

| ID | Constraint | Appeared in | Addressed in |
|----|------------| ----------- | ------------ |
| CON-1 | Application accessible from a variety of platforms via web browser |Stakeholder Feedback (Pre-iteration 1)| Iteration 1 |
| CON-2 | Application must be developed by the schools technical staff |Stakeholder Feedback (Pre-iteration 1)|--|
| CON-3 | First release planned after two months |Stakeholder Feedback (Pre-iteration 1)|--|
| CON-4 | A PoC should be presented within five weeks|Stakeholder Feedback (Pre-iteration 1)|Iteration 2|
| CON-5 | Adoption of open-source tecnologies |Stakeholder Feedback (Pre-iteration 1)|Iteration 1|
| CON-6 | It is intended that the introduction of new  meal descriptors affects very little, or nothing, other components of the application. |Stakeholder Feedback (Pre-iteration 1)|Iteration 2|
| CON-7 | A change in the meal identification number should not affect more than one architeture component |Stakeholder Feedback (Pre-iteration 1)|Iteration 3|
| CON-8 | Change in the generation of this number identification is to be implemented and tested with no side effects in 1 person-day of effort.|Stakeholder Feedback (Pre-iteration 1)|Iteration 3|

| CON-14 | This application must be developed by the schoolâ€™s technical sta and should be available in nine months |Pre-iteration 4|--|
| CON-15 | Within four weeks queries related to the number of available items for specific meals,but also adding and removing new items to inventory (microservices) should be demonstrated to many stakeholders |Pre-iteration 4|--|
| CON-16 | Aware of these dificulties, this very initial prototype does not need to use service discov-ery registries, but local method calls need to be replaced by synchronous remote calls,or better options. |Pre-iteration 4|--|
| CON-17 | Direct dependencies in the database are to be eliminated depending on the adopted data management strategies |Pre-iteration 4|--|
| CON-18 | For the nutritional descriptors, it is necessary to consider their designation, measureunit, but also the maximum reasonable amount to be used for validation purposes |Pre-iteration 4|--|
